# this script adds a new tool to ELMSLN. It creates the right directories
# in the domains folder, correctly symlinks to things inside of config
# and generates a stubbed out config area. Other setup scripts still need
# to fire in order to ensure that all domains / tools are in place and
# we also need to make sure that the source is updated to support the
# domains that we do but this gets a lot of the way there in conjunction
# with the drush plugin to automatically generate a new stack correctly
# off of a distro / dslm setup.

# where am i? move to where I am. This ensures source is properly sourced
