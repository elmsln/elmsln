ELMSLN 0.5.0, 2016-11-08 - Pumpkin
Another release, another big release. This update has massive performance, accessibility and usability enhancemnets. There's also built in support for mapping, xAPI visualization and tracking, read time statistical generation is now stable, PDF / Print mode printing, more refined media and testing work. The usability improvements associated with color and design now give greater context of where people are and what they are doing. MaterializeCSS has also been fully implemented, replacing our 2 year long run with Zurb Foundation / hacky / some materialize code. Materialize nets us a larger design community and really clean visualization / design patterns to start from. There's also a lot of work under the hood in stability and improvements people won't notice but that put us on better footing going forward, including Ubuntu 16 with PHP 7, MariaDB, and HTTP2 support for the fastest page delivery currently possible by web-stacks. There's also some experimental work for Angular 2.0 apps in the 2.x version of the Studio. The next release will focus more on getting this and other Angular experiments graduated to full usage. This release has the most issues stomped and functionality added since the project initially got a 0.0.0 release marker.

ELMSLN 0.3.1, 2016-06-08 - Pittsburgh
This sees a lot of improvements around deployments that have lots of courses by implementing a new network call methodology known as snake. This positions us to be able to propagate data across the network and keep it in sync without fear of the system crippling itself while doing so.

ELMSLN 0.2.1, 2016-03-17 - leprechaun
------------------------
This fixed a critical upgrade path issue that would cause sites to be out of sync with how we intend them to be at a base level. Things like base-line permissions, menu links, and many other issues resolved in 0.2.0 would not be reflected (potentially) for those using ELMSLN before major versions.
Breaking changes (though should only affect patient 0, aka btopro):
- remove all but core themes #706
- Remove piwik from core #746
Major changes:
- DR drup command needs a loop hole closed #523
Additional changes:
- add few forums to master #733
- Disable new-release notification for authorities during install #735
- Make sure discuss_helper is enabled OOTB #738
- Add OG field support to discuss #740
- ELMSLN js api #742
- Review features_builder as part of innovate #745
