ELMSLN 0.3.1, 2016-06-08 - Pittsburgh
This sees a lot of improvements around deployments that have lots of courses by implementing a new network call methodology known as snake. This positions us to be able to propagate data across the network and keep it in sync without fear of the system crippling itself while doing so. Users, Courses, Sections (and their associations) will all be kept in sync across authorities and services.
