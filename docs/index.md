ELMSLN
==============
ELMS Learning Network (ELMSLN) is an open source educational technology platform for building and sustaining innovation in course technologies. It accomplishes this by taking a Suite of Tools approach to learning design, allowing several systems to make up the different aspects of a course learning environment.  Each course effectively forms a network of technologies (hence the name) which can then be better tailored to each individual course's needs.
