The domains directory is structured in the optimal way for managing sites.  The domains directory is ignored below the initial directories inside of it, meaning that your sites that get written here automatically won’t be pushed through git or updated.  If you remove directories or change the way sites are managed in anyway inside this location, you’ll need to add that area to your .gitignore (or stop using the github version).

You can use this as a starting point and self manage from there but sticking as closely as possible to the structure of ELMSLN will help ensure upgrades down the road take correctly.
