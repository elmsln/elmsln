## H5P accessibility
H5P is a highly interactive HTML5 builder that’s built into ELMSLN. It’s also its own community of content types with varying levels of accessibility based on how dynamic they are. Because of how they are constructed, it’s possible for the H5P community to enhance the accessibility of items produced after the fact.
Still, there is work to be done and the accessibility of items can be tracked in one of two places:
- This comprehensive (but sure to fall out of date by a few months at a time) list by Penn State’s College of Earth and Mineral Sciences http://facdev.e-education.psu.edu/instdesigner/h5p
- H5P’s own roadmap which will have accessibility notions posted into each thread https://h5p.org/roadmap
