# Inbox

## What is envisioned?

Inbox is a calendar and messaging distribution where users can manage their studies.

The inbox will allow for students to receive course-related messages from their instructor, as well as automated reminders/notifications if something on their course requires their attention. For example, a deadline date reminder, or if someone has commented on their blog post etc.

The calendar will provide an easy view of all key dates generated across all students’ courses, including submission dates, deadline dates, scheduled events etc. Users will also be able to schedule their own events and add it to the calendar.
