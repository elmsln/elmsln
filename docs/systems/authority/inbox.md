# Inbox

## What is envisioned?

Inbox is a calendar and messaging distribution where users can manage their studies.

The inbox will allow for students to receive course-related messages from their instructor, as well as automated reminders/notifications if something on their course requires their attention. For example, a deadline date reminder, or if someone has commented on their blog post etc.

The calendar will provide an easy view of all key dates generated across all studentsâ€™ courses, including submission dates, deadline dates, scheduled events etc. Users will also be able to schedule their own events and add it to the calendar.
