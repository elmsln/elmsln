# Grades

## What is envisioned?

Grades/Assessment will utilise the Quiz module to allow the creation of more formal exams and assessments. Exams can be set up to be taken within the Assessment system itself, or to be embedded in other parts of the system. 

This is also the space where instructors go to manage the grading of submissions from both the assessment system and other distributions too, and integration with work already done on rubrics and a gradebook will allow for this.
