# People

## What is envisioned?

The People distribution will be a lightweight user management tool for enrolling users on a course, either by clicking manually or through the upload of files such as CSV or XML etc.
It will also store user preferences so that elements of their course can be displayed to them using custom settings.
Further to this, it will serve as the main ‘reporting’ tool for instructors/management to view data reports on student’s progress through a bridge with Learning Locker, allowing for the answering of questions such as, ‘which of my students are most active?’, ‘who has completed the following activity?’,  ‘which activity do students struggle with most?’ etc.
