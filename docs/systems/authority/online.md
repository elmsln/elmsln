CIS stands for Course Information System

This provides the logistical backend that is front and central in a typical LMS. This helps relate:
- Courses
- - Offerings
- - - Sections

Sections provide unique values that can bridge another data source like a roster management system, SIS, flat file, etc. You still need to integrate with these sources of data but this is providing support for unique grouping values that are common in these files.
