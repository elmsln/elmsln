Services are systems that are replicated once per course. This provides additional flexibility in a space where it may make more sense to have customization per course. Services are effectively being created dynamically as part of a new course being setup.

For example: If a course network is to use the content outlining tools and a blog, these tools being selected will actually produce 2 new drupal sites and network them together.

These sites call home, can sync roster / access rights with each and most importantly, fork from the original intention. While they shouldn't fork far, they can allow for faculty to have customized learning environments and teach the way they want to and need to in order to better connect with learners.

For example: forking from the default configuration of the online studio environment can allow an instructor to have a video centric conversation rather then an image centric one. We could later capture this innovation and make it repurposable but it's more important that we allow fragmentation in the short-term in order to spur innovation, test it, and capture it can come later.

"Capture" on the pedagogy side is making an option to setup future studios this way. "Capture" on the developer side is making Drupal Features to package the configuration so that it can be used in other distributions / future installs.
