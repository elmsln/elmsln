Authority systems are those that have a single source. These are systems in a network that really need to only exist in one place. For example, if there were multiple asset management systems, or per course asset management systems, it would become unmanagable.

Also, if there were multiple authorities of section data, it would become difficult to maintain integrity of sections across the rest of the network.
