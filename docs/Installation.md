https://github.com/btopro/elmsln/blob/master/INSTALL.md has the latest documentation on installing ELMSLN. There's also the ability to take it for a test drive in vagrant, a local development platform. Follow the instructions in the elmsln-vagrant repo (link in the sidebar).

We will have a public demo site soon as well which will highlight capabilities of the systems as they are built out in the network. For total control over taking ELMSLN for a spin, vagrant is the preferred method.
