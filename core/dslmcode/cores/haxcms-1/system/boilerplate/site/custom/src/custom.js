// Write whatever additional code you want to be included
// This could be webcomponents added directly here or using import statements
// to pull in and reference other web components / ES module compliant libraries.
// utilize bare imports like import "@things/stuff/stuff.js"; and ensure you reference the js file directly
// to make a custom theme see the following for a well documented fully working example
// https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents/blob/master/elements/example-haxcms-theme/example-haxcms-theme.js
// don't import that directory, we'd recommend copy and pasting it in here or
// creating your own theme based on it
