# HAXcms Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project as awesome as we possibly can.
It is the policy of HAXcms to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion,
creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation,
marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender,
gender identity, genetic information or political ideas.

Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and harassment or relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of HAXcms’s mission, and will not be tolerated in our community.

## Our standards

How you will keep our community awesome:

* Showing empathy to everyone
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Acting in the best interests of the community

Behaviors our community will not tolerate:

* Harassment - public or private
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling - derogatory interactions and personal or political attacks
* Doxing - publishing others' private information without permission
* Any conduct reasonably considered inappropriate in professional settings

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected
to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right to remove or modify comments, commits, code, documentation,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in spaces where an individual is 
representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using 
an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an official 
representative at an event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified 
by project maintainers.

The HAXcms Code of Conduct applies to anyone involved in the project, including project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of behavior which violates the HAXcms Code of Conduct may be reported by contacting 
project leadership at elmsln@psu.edu. The project leadership will review and investigate all complaints, and will 
respond in a way that it deems appropriate. The project leadership is obligated to maintain 
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies 
may be posted separately.

The HAXcms Code of Conduct was originally produced in the United States of America and operates based on US legal norms
which presumes innocence until guilt is proven.
