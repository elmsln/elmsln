 * Brands a function as a directive so that lit-html will call the function
 * during template rendering, rather than passing as a value.
 *
 * @param f The directive factory function. Must be a function that returns a
 * function of the signature `(part: Part) => void`. The returned function will
 * be called with the part object
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```
 * import {directive, html} from 'lit-html';
 *
 * const immutable = directive((v) => (part) => {
 *   if (part.value !== v) {
 *     part.setValue(v)
 *   }
 * });
