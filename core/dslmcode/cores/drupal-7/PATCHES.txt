DON’T HACK CORE!!!!

You’re right, you shouldn’t. That’s why these patches are documented changes
to Drupal core. These changes are primarily around minor notice / bug fixes
though there are some performance enhancement patches and entity_insert patches
thrown in for compatibility.

The performance patches should have 0 implication on anything other then speed.
They have been selected based on community recommendations by experts and have
been A/B comparison tested to highlight that they are indeed speeding up Drupal
over it’s stock version. Many of these run ahead of Pressflow D7 but my guess
is many will be adopted into it in the future.
