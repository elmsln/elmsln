The Flag module is a flexible flagging system whose primary goal is
to give all the control to the administrator. Using this module, the
site administrator can provide an arbitrary number of 'flags'.

A flag is really just a boolean toggle that is set on an entity such as a node,
comment, or user. Flags may be per-user, meaning that each user can flag an item
individually, or global, meaning that the item is either flagged or it
is not flagged, and any user who changes that changes it for everyone.

In this way, additional flags (similar to 'published' and 'sticky') can
be put on nodes, or other items, and dealt with by the system however
the administration likes.

Each flag allows the administrator to choose the 'flag this' text, and
the place where the user interface for flagging the item will appear
(For example: for nodes, whether a flagging link appears on the node
teaser as well on the full node view).

Each flag can be restricted to use only by certain roles. Each
flag provides data to the Views module, and provides a default
view to list 'My bookmarks'. These default views are somewhat crude,
but are easily tailored to whatever the system administrator would like
it to do.

Each flag also provides an 'argument' to the Views module that can be
used to allow a user to view other people's flagged content. This isn't
turned on by default anywhere, though, and the administrator will need
to construct a view in order to take advantage of it.

The Flag Bookmark module provides a simple flag called "bookmarks" and
a simple view for 'My bookmarks'. This is a default view provided by the
Flag module, but can be customized to fit the needs of your site. To
customize this view, go to admin/structure/views and find the
'flags_bookmarks' view. Click the 'Add' action to customize the view.
Once saved, the new version of the view will be used rather than the one
provided by Flag.

Besides editing the default view that comes with the module, Flag
provides many views filters, fields, and sort criteria to make all sorts of
displays possible relating to the number of times an item has been flagged.

This module was formerly known as Views Bookmark, which was originally was
written by Earl Miles. Flag was written by Nathan Haug and mystery man Mooffie.
