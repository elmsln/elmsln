# Background
The Learning Registry is a new approach to capturing, sharing, and analyzing
learning resource data to broaden the usefulness of digital content to benefit
educators and learners. Not a website or repository… not a search engine…
and not a replacement for the excellent sources of online learning content
that already exist.

The Learning Registry is an open source distribution system designed to
facilitate the exchange of data behind the scenes, and an open community
of resource creators, publishers, curators, and consumers who are
collaborating to broadly share resources, as well as information about how
those resources are used by educators in diverse learning environments
across the Web.

The intention of this module is to both publish and consume resources
from Drupal into the Learning Registry. In the future, we will also publish
and consume "usage data" of how items are being used by other Learning
Registry users.

At its current state, the publish functionality is operating successfully.
We're now working on pulling items from the Learning Registry and have
the search interface complete. Please email if you are looking to be part of
the project team. We have a developer's mailing list at
http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/learningregistry-drupal to ask
any questions or report feedback.
