Requirements
------------

1. The module does not provide an anti-virus scanner; it integrates with
   ClamAV (http://www.clamav.net), which is a free open-source anti-virus
   scanner.
2. Download/install ClamAV:
  - [Debian / Ubuntu]: apt-get install clamav
  - [redhat / CentOS]: yum install clamav

Installation
------------

1. Enable the module
2. Go to the ClamAV configuration page (admin/settings/clamav) and set
   the path to the ClamAV "clamscan" binary.  On most systems this will be:
   /usr/bin/clamscan
