  image style admin screen. This will allow us to easily create large sets of
  test/showcase styles and to fine tune this request before it lands in D8 core.


Imagecache Actions 7.x-1.0 2012-05-19
-------------------------------------
Incompatibilities:
- Effects that operate on the transparency layer, do not automatically change
  the format anymore to png. You will have to add this as a separate effect.
- File handling: the way that files (e.g. fonts, watermarks, backgrounds) are
  searched for has been aligned over all effects that work with an additional
  file. This may cause current styles to not being able to find specified files
  anymore.
- Custom actions: custom snippets are now executed using the PHP filter module,
  meaning that the image style editor must have the 'Use PHP for settings'
  permission to be able to edit the custom action snippet.
- Custom actions: information and variables that are available in your custom
  snippet have changed. See the README.txt of the custom actions module.

No changelog exists from before this 7.x-1.0 version. So the changelog starts
from here. 7.x-1.0 is the first reasonably well working D7 version. The 7.x-0.0
version was based on posted patches in the D7 port request issue and has never
been tested well. This 7.x-1.0 version is also not extensively tested by the
maintainers, but has been used in many (live) sites - currently (may 2012) over
5.000 reported 7.x-1.x-dev installs - so has received fairly good "test
coverage".
