# Version 2.0.0 (unreleased)
  
  This is a breaking version. You will need to refactor slightly in order to upgrade to this version from a previous version.

  * Complete re-write.
  * ratios are variables, not functions
  * Common variables are scoped to "ms-"
  * ms-lists() is the list functions
  * No more mixins at all, only functions.
  * Increased compatibility with Sass 3.1 and up
  * Compatibility with LibSass
  * Compass no longer required (non-integer values require Compass)
