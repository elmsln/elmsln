# Javascript Partials

This directory should be used for javascript files that need to be broken down for organization. All files will automatically be concatinated into script.js file.

If you would like to make your partials reusable use the `./js/modules` directory instead. See the modules `README.md` for instructions on how to register the modules as exports.
