A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/uyKhm.

 Use [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/) right now! Options for speed, localStorage saving, jog forward/backward, text size and dark/light theme, also with keyboard controls and progress bar. You'll never need to read conventionally again. 

localStorage implementation by [Keith Wyland](http://codepen.io/keithwyland/), thanks Keith!
